<div><p>Problems that cannot be solved do not exist in this world.</p><p>This is straining my heartstrings.</p><p>Time and titles do not matter in the bonds between people.</p><p>I'll admit that you're stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what's truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It's because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you'll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!</p><p>I think that "truth" is something that is covered up most of the time.</p><p>Sometimes, the questions are complicated - and the answers are simple.</p><p>Until just recently, the stars were something I only saw by myself.</p><p>Even if you lovingly collect every last piece of a shattered cup, pieces are still pieces. Once something breaks, it can never return.</p><p>In the battlefield, there is no place for hope. What lies there is only cold despair and a sin called victory, built on the pain of the defeated. All those people who met there have wholeheartedly admitted the evil and foolishness of this act called war. As long as people don't repent and don't regard it as the most evil taboo, then hell will endlessly reappear in the world.</p><p>*referring to the man that took her mothers life* I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him. But... I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it, or if it's because I'm strong enough not to.</p></div><iframe src="./10 random quotes file_files/widget.html" style="overflow: hidden; position: fixed; height: 155px; width: 400px; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; background: none; border: none; z-index: 2147483646; visibility: hidden; user-select: none;"></iframe></body><grammarly-desktop-integration data-grammarly-shadow-root="true"></grammarly-desktop-integration></html>
